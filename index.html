                                By ChatGPT, Middle-earth Political Correspondent
                                Barad-dûr, Mordor — April 23, 2025
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                In a stunning shift that has sent shockwaves from the Shire to the slopes of Mount Doom, the dark lands of Mordor have appointed Donald J. Trump as their new Supreme President following a bizarre and fiery campaign that saw orcs chanting “Make Mordor Great Again!” across the blasted plains.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The move comes after centuries of autocratic rule by Sauron, whose spirit was finally vanquished (again) after a dispute over unpaid soul taxes to the IRS (the Infernal Revenue Service). With the Eye now blind and the Dark Tower under new management, Mordor’s power vacuum drew opportunists, influencers, and former reality TV stars like flies to a Nazgûl carcass.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “I know evil. I wrote the book on deals. Sauron? Total lightweight,” President Trump announced at his coronation rally, held atop the refurbished ruins of Barad-dûr, now rebranded "Trump Tower: Middle-earth Edition." Dressed in blackened Mithril and a red “MMGA” cap, he waved to legions of orcs who screamed with joy (or perhaps general bloodlust—it’s always hard to tell).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A Divisive Campaign
                                Trump's campaign slogan, "Build the Wall of Shadow," promised to construct a massive obsidian wall around Mordor’s borders to “keep out the Elves, Hobbits, and all the losers from Gondor.” He also pledged to bring back traditional Mordorian values like industrial smog, endless war, and gluten-free lembas bans.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                His running mate, Saruman the Surprisingly Still Alive, described their platform as “a strong blend of necromancy, nationalism, and NFTs.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, not everyone is pleased. Elrond of Rivendell issued a statement condemning the appointment:
                                “This is an age of men, not bankrupt billionaires with a Ring fixation.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Controversy Over the Palantír
                                Critics have raised concerns about Trump's constant tweeting from the Palantír, which has caused blackouts across Middle-earth and at least three reality distortions in the Undying Lands. “I just use it to tell the truth,” Trump said, moments before accidentally summoning Shelob via an emoji.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Meanwhile, the Ents have staged a very slow but deliberate protest march outside Isengard chanting “No More Combovers!”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Orcs Love Him
                                Despite the outcry, Trump’s approval ratings among Mordorian citizens (mostly orcs, trolls, and over-leveraged Ringwraiths) remain sky-high. “He says what we’re all thinking,” said Gorbag, a local war chief. “And he finally fixed the potholes on Wraith Highway 9.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When asked about his foreign policy, President Trump stated:
                                “We’re going to strike a tremendous deal with Gondor. Huge. They need our lava. We have the best lava. Nobody has lava like us.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Looking Ahead
                                As Trump begins his first term in Mordor, many wonder how his leadership will shape the future of Middle-earth. Will peace endure? Will Mount Doom be turned into a luxury resort? Will the Nazgûl start offering rideshare services?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Only time will tell. But one thing is certain:
                                Middle-earth will never be the same again.

                            <h5>By Red Flagstone, Senior Satire Correspondent</h5>
                            <p>April 23, 2025</p>
                            <p>MAR-A-LAGO, FL — In a bold new press conference held from beneath a gilded chandelier shaped like the Constitution being rolled into a burrito, former and possibly future President Donald J. Trump assured the American public that he would never, ever, under any circumstances, deport actual American citizens.</p>
                            <p>Unless, of course, they “give off a vibe.”</p>
                            <p>“Look, nobody loves citizens more than me. Beautiful people. The best,” Trump began, wearing a lapel pin shaped like a bald eagle crying into a foreclosure notice. “But let’s be honest: some of them look very… deportable. You know it. I know it. Everyone knows it.”</p>
                            <p>Trump was referring to growing concerns after leaked internal memos from his hypothetical 2025 transition team suggested reintroducing a program called “Operation Freedom Relocation,” which critics say resembles forced deportation with a friendlier font and a free MAGA koozie.</p>
                            <p>When asked about reports of U.S. citizens being mistakenly swept up in prior immigration raids, Trump scoffed:
                                “Fake citizens. Total fakers. Probably actors. Very sneaky. Some of them had passports and everything—like they rehearsed it!”</p>
                            <h5>“Don’t Worry, We’ll Figure It Out Later”</h5>
                            <p>In response to questions about due process, Trump reassured reporters that any wrongly deported citizens would be mailed an apology letter, a coupon for 10% off at Trump Steaks, and “possibly fast-tracked for citizenship again—if they pass a vibe check.”</p>
                            <p>“Due process is great, I love due process, okay?” Trump said. “But sometimes, in the moment, you have to go with your gut. My gut is tremendous. A lot of people are saying it has instincts like a border collie.”</p>
                            <p>When asked if he had a plan to prevent lawful citizens from being mistakenly detained or expelled, he nodded solemnly:
                                “Absolutely. We’re going to give every real American a special hat. If you don’t have the hat, we ask questions.”</p>
                            <p>The hat, tentatively called the Freedom Cap, is expected to retail at $39.99 on the official campaign website and comes in four patriotic colors: Liberty White, Executive Order Red, Border Wall Beige, and Limited Edition Constitution Camo.</p>
                            <h5>Critics Respond</h5>
                            <p>Legal experts, civil rights advocates, and several confused bald eagles have condemned the statement, warning that it echoes dystopian policies with a distinctly fast-food twist.</p>
                            <p>“It’s like ‘1984’ met QVC and had a very confused baby,” said one ACLU representative, while being forcibly removed for not clapping during a Trump joke about “deporting wokeism.”</p>
                            <p>Trump, unbothered, ended the press conference by launching Freedom Caps into the crowd like T-shirts at a monster truck rally and yelling:
                                “America first! Second citizenship, maybe! Third strike? You're outta here!”</p>

                        MAR-A-LAGO, FL — Former President Donald J. Trump announced today that he is launching a “historic and very classy” lawsuit against the entire European Union, accusing it of “orchestrating the greatest fake news campaign since the invention of baguettes.”

                            <h5>By Red Flagstone, International Lawsuit Correspondent</h5>
                            <p>April 23, 2025</p>
                            <p>MAR-A-LAGO, FL — Former President Donald J. Trump announced today that he is launching a “historic and very classy” lawsuit against the entire European Union, accusing it of “orchestrating the greatest fake news campaign since the invention of baguettes.”</p>
                            <p>“Let me tell you, nobody has ever sued Europe before,” Trump said at a press conference held in front of a fountain shaped like Lady Liberty throwing shade. “Not like this. Not bigly. I’m talking ALL of it—France, Germany, the little ones like Slovenia, even the spicy one—Spain.”</p>
                            <p>The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court of Twitter (formerly known as Truth Social), claims that EU member nations have “intentionally and maliciously used foreign accents, fancy breads, and suspiciously metric facts to undermine my reputation worldwide.”</p>
                            <p>Trump specifically cited a Brussels-based satirical cartoon that depicted him as a confused gladiator in a coliseum made of croissants, calling it “highly disrespectful to both my legacy and my gluten tolerance.”</p>
                            <h5>“I’m Very Loved in Europe, Believe Me”</h5>
                            <p>When asked if he had legal jurisdiction to sue an entire continent, Trump replied, “Absolutely. Look, I’ve built hotels in places with no vowels. I know how Europe works. You can sue anybody. I once sued a cloud for raining on a golf tournament.”</p>
                            <p>EU officials responded with a joint statement simply reading:</p>
                            <p><span style="font-size: 30px;">LOL</span></p>
                            <p>Trump now seeks $3 trillion in emotional damages, two Eiffel Towers, and “control of Italy’s pasta supply.”</p>
                            <p>Legal scholars remain baffled, but sources close to the former president say he’s confident.</p>
                            <p>“He’s already rehearsing his victory speech in Dutch. It’s mostly just saying ‘tremendous’ with a windmill accent,” said one aide.</p>
